1. AWS Account Setup & Landing Zone
    Corporates create multiple accounts (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod) for better isolation, billing, and compliance. Helps IT teams avoid mixing workloads.


2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
    Used to create secure, private networks in the cloud. Corporates set up public subnets (for apps accessible to users) and private subnets (for databases, internal apps).


3. IAM (Identity & Access Management)
    Ensures employees, apps, and vendors have minimum required permissions. E.g., HR team only sees payroll data, developers can’t touch billing.

4. Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty)
    a. CloudWatch → app & infra monitoring (CPU, memory, logs).
    b. CloudTrail → audit logs of who did what.
    c. Config → ensures compliance (e.g., no open S3 buckets).
    d. GuardDuty → threat detection, alerts for attacks.

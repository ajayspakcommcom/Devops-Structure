Sample Cost Estimates by Service
    Below is a rough guide. Use it to set baseline pricing tiers for your clients (e.g., “Small / Medium / Enterprise”).



| AWS Service / Category                               | Cost Drivers / What you pay for                                       | Sample Price or Range                                                                        | Notes & Caveats                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 (Compute / Virtual Machines)**                 | vCPU-hours, memory, instance type, OS, storage, data transfer         | e.g. “$0.05 per vCPU-hour for Linux” in On-Demand mode ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])      | If client uses Reserved or Spot, cost reduces significantly. Add EBS storage, network, backup, etc. |
| **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**               | Usually free (for basic user/role management)                         | **No charge** for general IAM usage ([docs.aws.amazon.com][2])                               | Some IAM subfeatures (like IAM Access Analyzer) have charges. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][3])      |
| **S3 (Object Storage)**                              | Storage (GB-month), PUT/GET requests, data transfer (in / out)        | e.g. $0.023 per GB / month for first 50 TB in Standard class ([CloudZero][4])                | Infrequent access, Glacier / archived tiers cost much lower but incur retrieval costs.              |
| **EBS / EFS (Block / File Storage)**                 | GB-month, IOPS, throughput, snapshot storage                          | Varies widely (often $0.05–$0.15 per GB-month for general SSD)                               | Choose types (gp3 / io2 / st1 / sc1) based on performance needs.                                    |
| **RDS (Managed Relational DB)**                      | DB instance hours, storage, IOPS, backup, standby / multi-AZ, network | Could run dozens to hundreds of USD per month for moderate workloads                         | Multi-AZ or high availability adds extra cost.                                                      |
| **DynamoDB (NoSQL)**                                 | Read/write capacity units (RCU/WCU), storage, on-demand mode          | Depends on throughput; small workloads might cost $10–$100s per month                        | Auto-scaling, on-demand mode means more flexibility, but cost is variable.                          |
| **ElastiCache (Redis / Memcached)**                  | Node hours, instance size, data transfer                              | Comparable to EC2 for similar instance class                                                 | Useful as caching layer; cost scales with memory and cluster size.                                  |
| **Route 53 (DNS / Domain / Routing)**                | Hosted zones per month, queries per million                           | Very low: typically a few USD per hosted zone + small per-query cost                         | Good to bundle / absorb in base fees for clients.                                                   |
| **CloudFront (CDN)**                                 | Data transfer out, HTTP/HTTPS requests                                | Varies by region, but e.g. tens of USD for medium traffic                                    | If client has heavy traffic (video, media), this becomes significant.                               |
| **ALB / NLB (Load Balancers)**                       | Hourly load balancer cost + LCU (Load-balancer Capacity Units) usage  | Could be $18–$25 per ALB per month + usage                                                   | Complex traffic patterns increase LCU.                                                              |
| **API Gateway**                                      | Requests, data processed, caching                                     | e.g. $3.50 per million requests (example region)                                             | If APIs are high volume, this can accumulate.                                                       |
| **AWS Lambda (Serverless)**                          | Number of requests, compute time (GB-s)                               | Could be <$1 per million small invocations                                                   | Cold starts, memory amount affect cost.                                                             |
| **WAF / Shield**                                     | Per web ACL, per rule, or protection tier                             | A few dollars to tens of dollars per month                                                   | For large clients with web apps, include in security package.                                       |
| **Secrets Manager / Parameter Store**                | Secrets stored per month, API calls                                   | Secrets Manager ~ $0.40 per secret / month + API usage                                       | Parameter Store (standard tier) might be free / lower cost.                                         |
| **CI/CD / DevOps Tooling (CodePipeline, CodeBuild)** | Build minutes, pipeline executions                                    | e.g., $0.005 per build minute, etc.                                                          | Use efficient pipelines and caching to reduce cost.                                                 |
| **Athena / Glue (Data Analytics / ETL)**             | Query data scanned (Athena), data processing / ETL load (Glue)        | Athena ~$5 per TB scanned (varies by region)                                                 | Encourages optimizing queries (partitioning, compression).                                          |
| **Redshift (Data Warehouse)**                        | Node-hours, storage, snapshots                                        | Moderate to high depending on cluster size                                                   | Doesn’t scale linearly—design for performance vs cost.                                              |
| **SageMaker (ML / AI)**                              | Training hours, inference hours, storage, data transfer               | Can run from tens to thousands USD per model depending on scale                              | For small use, cost is manageable; large models cost more.                                          |
| **Step Functions / EventBridge / SQS / SNS**         | State transitions, events processed, payload size                     | Often small (cents to dollars) for modest usage                                              | Highly scalable; cost only becomes material at large scale.                                         |
| **AWS Backup**                                       | GB stored in backup vaults, restores                                  | $0.05 per GB (example) for backup storage ([N2W Software][5])                                | If client wants frequent backups or cross-region DR, cost increases.                                |
| **Support / Premium Services**                       | Percentage of AWS spend or minimum flat fee                           | E.g. Business Support = 10% of first $10K then lower tiers. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][6]) | Must include this when quoting to clients.                                                          |

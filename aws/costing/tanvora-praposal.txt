Tanvora Cloud Services Proposal

    a. Introduction
        1. Tanvora provides end-to-end AWS Cloud Solutions following industry-standard practices used by MNCs.
        2. We use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for server/application configuration to ensure automation, reliability, and scalability for your business.

            2. Secure Configuration (IAM, SSL via ACM, Security Groups, WAF if required)
            3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) â€“ repeatable, version-controlled infra deployment
            4. Configuration Management (Ansible) â€“ automated software installation, patching, deployments
            5. Monitoring & Backup (CloudWatch, Snapshots, DR setup)
            6. Ongoing Support & Optimization

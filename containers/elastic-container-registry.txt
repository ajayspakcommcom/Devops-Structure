Amazon ECR – Key Pointers

    1. What is ECR?
        . A fully managed container image registry for storing, managing, and deploying Docker/OCI images.
        . Think of it as AWS’s private Docker Hub, deeply integrated with ECS, EKS, App Runner, and Lambda.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Secure, scalable storage for container images.
        . Removes the need to run your own registry.
        . Integrated with IAM, KMS, CloudTrail for enterprise-grade security.
        . Used as the standard image repository for ECS, EKS, App Runner deployments.

    3. Types of Repositories
        . Private Repositories → default, IAM-based access control.
        . Public Repositories → share images publicly (like Docker Hub).
        . Immutable Tags → prevent overwriting existing images (best practice).

    4. Security
        . Integrated with AWS IAM → fine-grained access policies.
        . Image Scanning (Amazon Inspector) → detect vulnerabilities (CVEs).
        . Encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS).
        . Lifecycle policies → auto-cleanup old/unused images.

    5. Integration
        . ECS/EKS → pull images directly from ECR.
        . CodePipeline/CodeBuild → push built images to ECR.
        . App Runner & Lambda → run functions/services from ECR images.
        . Cross-Account Access → share images across AWS accounts.

    6. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
            . Storage → $0.10 per GB-month.
            . Data transfer out (standard AWS transfer pricing).
        . Free:
            . Image pulls within same region (e.g., ECS pulling from ECR).
            . First 500MB storage per month in private repos.

    7. Industry Standards
    ✅ . Use private repositories with IAM + KMS encryption.
    ✅ . Enable vulnerability scanning for compliance.
    ✅ . Use immutable tags (e.g., v1.0.0) instead of latest.
    ✅ . Apply lifecycle policies to clean unused images.
    ✅ . Automate builds & pushes via CI/CD pipelines.
    ✅ . Use cross-account sharing in multi-account setups (dev/prod separation).

    8. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Microservices → Store Docker images for ECS/EKS services.
       . CI/CD → Build pipeline pushes images to ECR → ECS/EKS deploy.
       . Hybrid Cloud → Private registry with fine-grained IAM controls.
       . Public Distribution → Companies sharing public container images.

    9.✅Summary
        . Amazon ECR = secure, managed container image registry.
            . Best for storing Docker/OCI images used in ECS, EKS, App Runner, Lambda.
            . Industry best practices = IAM policies, KMS encryption, scanning, immutable tags, lifecycle cleanup.

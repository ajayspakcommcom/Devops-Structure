Key Pointers for Creating an S3 Bucket

    a. Bucket Name
        1. Must be globally unique (across all AWS accounts).
        2. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no uppercase or underscores).
        3. Follow naming conventions (e.g., tanvora-prod-app-logs).

    b. Region Selection
        1. Choose the AWS Region close to your users or workloads to reduce latency and costs.
        2. Some features (like S3 Object Lambda, Access Points) may vary by region.

    c. Ownership & Access Control
        1. Block Public Access: Enabled by default; only disable if you need public files (like static website hosting).
        2. Use IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access instead of bucket ACLs (deprecated for most cases).
        3. Consider S3 Access Points for multi-team environments.

    d. Encryption
        a. Enable default encryption:    
            1. SSE-S3 (managed by AWS).
            2. SSE-KMS (for tighter security with AWS KMS).
        b. Enforce encryption policies to prevent unencrypted uploads.

    f. Versioning
        1. Turn on versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object.
        2. Helps protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.    

    g. Lifecycle Policies
        1. Define Lifecycle rules:
            1. Transition objects to cheaper storage classes (Glacier/IA).
            2. Expire old versions automatically.

    i. Logging & Monitoring
        1. Enable S3 Access Logs or CloudTrail Data Events for auditing.
        2. Use CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms for monitoring access patterns.

    j. Replication
        1. Use Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for DR (Disaster Recovery).
        2. Use Same-Region Replication (SRR) for compliance/multi-account setups.

    k. Storage Class
        a. Choose the right storage class:
            1. Standard (frequently accessed).
            2. Standard-IA / One Zone-IA (infrequently accessed).
            3. Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive (archival).
            4. Intelligent-Tiering (auto-optimizes cost).

    l. Cost Optimization
        1. Use S3 Storage Lens for insights.
        2. Monitor with AWS Budgets to avoid surprise costs.
        3. Compress and optimize files before upload.            

    m. Security Best Practices
        1. Use VPC Endpoints to keep traffic inside AWS.
        2. Apply bucket policies with Principal, Action, Resource, Condition carefully.
        3. Enforce MFA Delete for versioned buckets.

    n. Additional Features
        1. Static Website Hosting: Only if you need to serve web assets.
        2. CORS Configuration: If accessed from browsers across domains.
        3. Object Lock: For compliance (WORM – Write Once, Read Many).

✅o. Summary:        
    For corporate/production, the mandatory practices are:
        1. Unique name & correct region
        2. Block public access
        3. Enable encryption (SSE-KMS)
        4. Enable versioning
        5. Define lifecycle rules
        6. Monitor (CloudWatch/CloudTrail)
        7. Apply IAM-based access policies
        8. Optimize costs with right storage class

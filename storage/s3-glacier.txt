Amazon S3 Glacier – Key Pointers

    a. What is it?
        1. Low-cost archival storage in S3 for data you don’t need to access often.
        2. Designed for compliance, backups, archives, and disaster recovery.
        3. Costs much lower than S3 Standard/IA but retrieval times are slower3

    b. Glacier Storage Classes
        Amazon provides 3 Glacier classes (you choose when setting lifecycle rules):
            1. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
                a. Millisecond retrieval, lower cost than Standard-IA.
                b. Best for archives accessed a few times a year but need quick access
            2. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (classic Glacier)
                a. Cheapest for archives with occasional access.
                b. Retrieval: minutes to hours (Expedited, Standard, Bulk options)
            3. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
                a. Lowest-cost storage in AWS.
                b. Retrieval in hours (12–48 hrs).
                c. Best for compliance/regulatory data that must be kept for 7–10+ years.

    c. How You Use It
        1. You don’t create a separate Glacier bucket.
        2. Instead, you:
            a. Create an S3 bucket.
            b. Apply Lifecycle policies to transition objects → Glacier (Instant, Flexible, or Deep Archive).
            c. Retrieve when needed (via S3 console/SDK/CLI).
    
    d. Retrieval Options
        1. Expedited: 1–5 minutes (costlier).
        2. Standard: 3–5 hours.
        3. Bulk: 5–12 hours, cheapest.
        4. (Instant Retrieval = milliseconds)

    
    e. Pricing Model
        1. Very cheap storage (as low as $1/TB/month in Deep Archive).
        2. Retrieval costs extra (per GB + per request).
        3. Minimum storage duration charge
            a. Glacier Instant: 90 days.
            b. Glacier Flexible: 90 days.
            c. Glacier Deep Archive: 180 days

    f. Security
        Same as S3:
            1. Encryption at rest (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
            2. Access controlled by IAM policies, bucket policies.

    g. Industry Standards
    ✅1. Use Glacier Instant Retrieval for data that must be archived but occasionally queried (logs, compliance reports).
    ✅2. Use Glacier Flexible for infrequent restore needs (legal, research, backups).
    ✅3. Use Deep Archive for 7–10+ year compliance retention (banking, healthcare, government).
    ✅4. Always combine with Lifecycle Policies (automatic transition).
    ✅5. Monitor retrieval costs → retrieval is the “trap” if not planned.

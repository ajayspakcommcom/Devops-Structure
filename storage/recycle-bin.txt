AWS Recycle Bin – Key Pointers

    a. What is it?
        1. A data recovery feature for AWS resources.
        2. Lets you define retention rules so that if a resource is accidentally deleted, it goes to the Recycle Bin instead of being permanently deleted immediately.
        3. Works for EBS snapshots, EBS-backed AMIs, and other supported backups.

    b. How It Works
        1. You create Retention Rules:
            a. Define resource type (EBS snapshot, AMI, AWS Backup recovery point).
            b. Define tag filters (only apply to specific resources).
            c. Set a retention period (e.g., keep deleted snapshots for 7 days).
        2. When someone deletes the resource → it moves into Recycle Bin.
        3. It stays recoverable until retention expires → then permanently deleted.

    c. Use Cases
        1. Protect against accidental deletion by admins or automation.
        2. Provide a grace period before critical backups are lost.
        3. Add an extra layer on top of AWS Backup for compliance.

    d. Security
        1. IAM policies control who can manage Recycle Bin rules.
        2. Resources in Recycle Bin remain encrypted if they were encrypted.
        3. Works with AWS Backup Vault Lock for compliance.

    e. Monitoring
        1. CloudTrail logs all recycle bin operations.
        2. CloudWatch can be used for alerts if critical resources get deleted.

    f. Industry Standards
    ✅ 1. Define retention rules (7–30 days) for EBS snapshots and Backups.
    ✅ 2. Use tagging strategy → only critical snapshots enter Recycle Bin.
    ✅ 3. Combine with AWS Backup for multi-layer protection.
    ✅ 4. Use Vault Lock + Recycle Bin for compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

    g. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        1. DevOps teams: Protect from accidental terraform destroy or script deletions.
        2. Finance & Healthcare: Compliance retention before permanent delete.
        3. Enterprise IT: Safety net for DR snapshots/AMIs.

    h. Summary
        1. AWS Recycle Bin = “undo delete” for critical resources like EBS snapshots, AMIs, and AWS Backup recovery points.
        2. Retention rules → define how long deleted resources are recoverable.
        3. Industry standard → use Recycle Bin alongside AWS Backup + Vault Lock for layered data protection.

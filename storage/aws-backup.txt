AWS Backup – Key Pointers

a. What is it?
    1. A fully managed backup service.
    2. Automates and centralizes backup of AWS resources → no need to write custom scripts.
    3. Ensures compliance, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

b. Supported AWS Services
    AWS Backup can protect:
        1. EBS volumes (block storage).
        2. EC2 instances (via AMIs).
        3. RDS databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.).
        4. DynamoDB tables.
        5. S3 buckets.
        6. EFS & FSx file systems.
        7. Storage Gateway volumes.
        8. DocumentDB, Neptune, etc.
    (Coverage keeps expanding — it’s meant to be the “one-stop backup solution”).


c. Backup Plan
    You define backup plans (like policies):
        1. Backup schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.).
        2. Backup window (when to run).
        3. Retention rules (how long to keep).
        4. Lifecycle (transition backups to cold storage like Glacier).

d. Vaults
    1. Backups are stored in Backup Vaults.
    2. Vaults can use KMS encryption keys.
    3. You can apply access policies (who can restore/delete).

e. Cross-Region & Cross-Account Backup
    a. Supports Cross-Region backup (disaster recovery).
    b. Supports Cross-Account backup (multi-account setups in AWS Organizations).

f. Restore
    1. You can restore:
        a. An EBS snapshot → back to a new EBS volume.
        b. An RDS backup → new RDS instance.
        c. DynamoDB backup → new table.
    2. Works seamlessly across services.

g. Compliance Features
    1. Backup Audit Manager → tracks compliance against policies (like HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
    2. Immutable backups (Vault Lock) → Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM).
    3. Centralized logs via CloudTrail + CloudWatch.

h. Cost Model
    1. Pay for backup storage used (charged separately from original resource).
    2. Pay for restore operations (per GB restored).
    3. Pricing varies by storage tier:
        a. Warm tier (frequent restores).
        b. Cold tier (archival, Glacier-based).

i. Industry Standards
✅ 1. Create centralized backup policies across accounts using AWS Organizations.
✅ 2. Use Vault Lock for compliance (prevents deletion/tampering).
✅ 3. Store long-term backups in Glacier for cost efficiency.
✅ 4. Use Cross-Region backups for DR.
✅ 5. Enable Backup Audit Manager for reporting.

h. Typical Corporate Use Cases
    1. Banks & Financials → Meet compliance for 7–10 year data retention.
    2. Healthcare → Daily RDS + S3 backups with encryption.
    3. E-commerce → EBS + DynamoDB backups for HA/DR.
    4. Government → Vault Lock for tamper-proof backups.


i. Summary:
    1. AWS Backup = centralized backup solution across AWS services.
    2. Industry uses it for automation, compliance, DR, and cost optimization.
    3. Best practices = cross-region + vault lock + lifecycle rules → Glacier.

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) – Key Pointers
    a. What is it?
        1. A disaster recovery (DR) service that lets you quickly recover applications from on-premises or cloud into AWS after an outage.
        2. Replaces the older CloudEndure Disaster Recovery service.
        3. Provides low-cost standby + fast failover in AWS.

    b. How It Works
        1. Install a lightweight agent on your on-premises servers (physical/virtual/cloud).
        2. Agent continuously replicates data to AWS → stored in a staging area (low-cost EC2 + EBS).
        3. In disaster, you launch recovery instances in minutes (EC2).
        4. After disaster, you can fail back to on-prem.

    c. Supported Sources
        1. On-premises: VMware, Hyper-V, Physical servers.
        2. Cloud: Azure, GCP, other AWS Regions/accounts.
        3. OS: Windows + Linux servers.

    d. Key Features
        1. Continuous block-level replication (near real-time).
        2. Point-in-time recovery (keep multiple recovery checkpoints).
        3. Automated orchestration for failover/failback.
        4. Test recovery drills anytime without disrupting production.

    e. Recovery Time & Point Objectives
        1. RPO (Recovery Point Objective): seconds.
        2. RTO (Recovery Time Objective): minutes (launch new EC2 instances).
        3. Industry standards for DR.
    
    f. Security
        Data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (EBS/KMS).
        IAM roles control who can trigger failover.
        Compliant with HIPAA, GDPR, SOC, etc.

    g. Cost Model
        1. Low-cost staging area: small EC2 + low-cost storage for replication.
        2. Pay only for:
            a. Staging infra + data replication.
            b. Full-scale EC2/EBS only when disaster occurs or during drills.
        3. Much cheaper than running duplicate infra 24/7.

    h. Industry Standards
    ✅ 1. Use multi-region DR (replicate workloads to a different AWS Region).
    ✅ 2. Regularly perform DR drills using non-disruptive testing.
    ✅ 3. Combine with AWS Backup + Recycle Bin for full data protection.
    ✅ 4. Encrypt all replication with KMS keys.
    ✅ 5. Automate failover playbooks with AWS Systems Manager.

    i. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        1. Banking/Finance → must meet regulatory RTO/RPO requirements.
        2. Healthcare → ensure critical apps remain available.
        3. E-commerce → avoid downtime during outages.
        4. Manufacturing → protect against ransomware attacks.

    j. Summary:
        AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery = enterprise-grade failover system.
            1. Replicates on-prem/cloud workloads into AWS.
            2. Provides seconds RPO, minutes RTO.
            3. Much cheaper than hot-standby because you pay full cost only during disaster or test.

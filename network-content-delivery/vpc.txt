Amazon VPC – Key Pointers

    1. What is VPC?
        . A logically isolated virtual network in AWS.
        . Lets you define and control:
            . IP address ranges (CIDR blocks)
            . Subnets (public/private)
            . Route tables
            . Network gateways (IGW, NAT, Transit Gateway, VPN, DX)
            . Security controls (SGs, NACLs)

    2. Why Use It?
        . Every AWS resource (EC2, RDS, ECS/EKS, Lambda in VPC) runs inside a VPC.
        . Gives you full control over networking like in an on-prem datacenter.
        . Enables segmentation (public vs private), security, and compliance.


    3. Core Components
        . CIDR Block → e.g., 10.0.0.0/16.
        . Subnets:
        . Public Subnet → Internet accessible (via Internet Gateway).
        . Private Subnet → Internal only, outbound via NAT Gateway.
        . Route Tables → control traffic routing between subnets.
        . Internet Gateway (IGW) → allows inbound/outbound to internet.
        . NAT Gateway → private subnet → outbound internet.
        . Security Groups (SGs) → stateful firewall at instance level.
        . Network ACLs (NACLs) → stateless firewall at subnet level.
        . VPC Peering / Transit Gateway → connect multiple VPCs.
        . VPC Endpoints → private access to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.).

    4. Security
        . SGs → stateful, allow only defined inbound/outbound.=
        . NACLs → stateless, explicit rules for allow/deny.
        . Flow Logs → log traffic (accepted/rejected) for compliance & monitoring.
        . PrivateLink / Endpoints → keep traffic off the public internet.


    5. Cost Model
        . VPC itself is free.
        . You pay for:
            . NAT Gateway (per hour + per GB processed).
            . VPC Endpoints (per hour).
            . Transit Gateway (per attachment + per GB).
            . Data transfer across AZs/regions.

    6. Industry Standards
       . Always use at least 2–3 AZs for HA.
    ✅ . Design with public + private subnets (multi-tier architecture).
    ✅ . Use NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access.
    ✅ . Use VPC Endpoints for private access to AWS services.
    ✅ . Enable VPC Flow Logs for monitoring.
    ✅ . Use Transit Gateway (instead of complex peering mesh) in enterprise setups.
    ✅ . Separate dev, staging, prod VPCs (multi-account strategy with AWS Organizations).

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Web Apps → Public subnet (ALB) + Private subnet (EC2/RDS).
       . Hybrid Cloud → Extend VPC with VPN/Direct Connect to on-prem.
       . Enterprise Networking → Hub-and-spoke via Transit Gateway.
       . Secure Analytics → PrivateLink + S3/DynamoDB without internet.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon VPC = foundation of AWS networking.
            . Define your own isolated network with full control.
            . Core for security, HA, hybrid connectivity.
            . Industry best practice → multi-AZ, public/private subnets, endpoints, monitoring with Flow Logs.

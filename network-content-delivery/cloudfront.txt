Amazon CloudFront – Key Pointers

    1. What is CloudFront?
        . A global content delivery network (CDN).
        . Caches and delivers content (websites, APIs, videos, software) to users from edge locations worldwide.
        . Reduces latency, improves performance, and offloads origin servers (like S3, ALB, or EC2).

    2. Why Use It?
        . Improve performance (low latency, high transfer speed).
        . Reduce origin load & cost.
        . Enhance security (integrates with AWS Shield, WAF, ACM).
        . Enable global reach with 400+ edge locations.

    
    3. Core Features
        . Origins: S3, ALB, EC2, EKS/ECS, or custom on-prem servers.
        . Caching: Configurable TTL, cache invalidation.
        . HTTPS by default with ACM SSL/TLS.
        . Edge Functions:
           . Lambda@Edge → run custom logic at edge (auth, redirects, headers).
           . CloudFront Functions → lightweight JS at edge.
        . Geo-Restriction → allow/deny content by country.
        . Signed URLs/Cookies → secure premium content.

    
    4. Security
        . TLS encryption (free ACM certs).
        . AWS WAF integration for app-layer firewall.
        . AWS Shield Standard → free DDoS protection.
        . OAC (Origin Access Control) → restrict direct access to S3/ALB.

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
           . Data transfer out (varies by region).
           . HTTP/HTTPS requests.
           . Optional: invalidations, Lambda@Edge.
        . Free tier → 1 TB data transfer out/month for 12 months.
        . Usually cheaper than serving content directly from S3/EC2 for global users.

    6. Industry Standards
✅      . Put CloudFront in front of all public-facing apps (S3, ALB, API Gateway).
✅      . Use OAC + private S3 buckets → secure content.
✅      . Cache static assets (images, videos, JS, CSS) aggressively.
✅      . Use signed URLs/cookies for premium or private content.
✅      . Enable WAF rules for security (SQLi, XSS).
✅      . Monitor with CloudWatch + CloudFront Reports.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Websites → Static + dynamic content distribution.
       . APIs → Accelerate REST/GraphQL APIs globally.
       . Media/OTT → Video streaming (HLS/DASH).
       . E-commerce → Low-latency product images/catalog.
       . Software distribution → Secure download delivery.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon CloudFront = global CDN for fast, secure content delivery.
            . Improves latency & performance worldwide.
            . Integrates with S3, ALB, API Gateway.
            . Industry best practices = use OAC, enable WAF/Shield, cache static content, use signed URLs for private access.

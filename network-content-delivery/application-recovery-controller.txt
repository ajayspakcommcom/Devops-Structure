AWS Application Recovery Controller – Key Pointers
    1. What is ARC?
        . A high availability and disaster recovery (DR) service.
        . Helps you monitor readiness of multi-AZ/multi-region apps and control failover during outages.
        . Ensures applications meet RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) goals.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Running apps across regions is complex — ARC provides:
            . Readiness checks → continuously validates DR configuration.
            . Routing controls → shift traffic between regions with one click/API.
            . Safety rules → prevent misconfigurations (e.g., can’t route 100% traffic to a failing region).
        . Helps enterprises prove compliance (finance, healthcare, government).

    3. Core Features
        . Readiness Checks
            . Validate resources (ALB, RDS, DynamoDB, EC2, Route 53, etc.) are configured correctly for failover.
        . Routing Controls
            . Control how traffic flows between regions (via Route 53 ARC-ready health checks).
            . One-click or API-driven failover.
        . Safety Rules
            . Guardrails to prevent unsafe routing changes.
        . Continuous Audit
            . Ongoing monitoring of resources to ensure they’re DR-ready.

    4. Integration
        . Route 53 ARC APIs → for traffic routing control.
        . Global Accelerator + Route 53 → to shift traffic across regions.
        . CloudWatch/CloudTrail → monitoring & logging failover events.
        . Works with multi-region architectures (Aurora Global DB, DynamoDB Global Tables, S3 CRR, etc.).

    5. Security
        . IAM policies → who can trigger failover.
        . Audit logs in CloudTrail for compliance.
        . Built-in safety rules prevent misrouting all traffic.

    6. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
            . Readiness checks (per resource monitored).
            . Routing controls (per control/hour).
        . Additional costs: Route 53 health checks, data transfer, Global Accelerator (if used).

    7. Industry Standards
        . Use ARC when running mission-critical apps in multi-region active-active or active-passive mode.
✅      . Always define safety rules → to avoid human errors in failover.
✅      . Integrate ARC with CI/CD pipelines → test failover automatically.
✅      . Monitor readiness continuously (not only during disasters).
✅      . Use Route 53 + Global Accelerator for global traffic routing.

    8. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Financial services → regulatory compliance, DR for trading platforms.
        . Healthcare → strict RTO/RPO for patient systems.
        . E-commerce → keep storefronts live during regional outages.
        . Gaming → redirect players globally in case of server/regional failure.
        . Government → compliance with continuity-of-operations rules.

    9. Summary
        . AWS Application Recovery Controller = multi-region DR readiness + failover orchestration service.
            . Provides readiness checks, routing controls, and safety rules.
            . Industry best practices → combine with Route 53/Global Accelerator, run multi-region, continuously validate DR setup.

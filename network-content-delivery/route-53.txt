Amazon Route 53 – Key Pointers

    1. What is Route 53?
        . A highly available, scalable DNS service on AWS.
            . Provides:
                . Domain registration (buy/manage domains).
                . DNS hosting (map names to AWS resources).
                . Health checks & failover.
                . Traffic routing policies (latency, geolocation, weighted, etc.).
    
    2. Why Use It?
        . Connects users to AWS services (EC2, ALB, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway).
        . Highly reliable (100% availability SLA).
        . Integrates deeply with AWS infra + Global Accelerator.
        . Advanced routing + failover for global apps.

    3. Core Features
        . DNS Service → Map domain → IP/Load Balancer/CloudFront.
        . Domain Registration → Purchase/manage directly in Route 53.
        . Routing Policies:
           . Simple → 1:1 record.
           . Weighted → split % traffic between multiple endpoints.
           . Latency-based → route to region with lowest latency.
           . Geolocation → route based on user’s location.
           . Failover → send traffic to healthy endpoint.
           . Multi-value → like round-robin DNS with health checks.
        . Health Checks → automatic failover if endpoint unhealthy.
        . Private Hosted Zones → DNS for resources inside VPC only.

    4. Security
        . DNSSEC support for domain security.
        . IAM policies to manage hosted zones.
        . Works with VPC + PrivateLink for internal DNS.

    5. Cost Model
        . $0.50/month per hosted zone (first 25).
        . $0.40/month per hosted zone (after 25).
        . $0.40 per million queries (standard).
        . Health checks billed separately.
        . Domain registration pricing varies by TLD.

    6. Industry Standards
       . Always enable health checks + failover routing for HA.
    ✅ . Use latency-based routing for global apps.
    ✅ . Use geolocation routing for compliance/localization.
    ✅ . Use private hosted zones for VPC-only workloads.
    ✅ . Use Route 53 + ACM (certificates) for HTTPS endpoints.
    ✅ . Combine with Global Accelerator for static IP + routing optimization.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce → high-availability DNS for websites + APIs.
        . SaaS apps → global traffic routing (weighted/canary).
        . Gaming → direct users to nearest game server.
        . Financial services → compliance with geo-routing.
        . Hybrid Cloud → private hosted zones for internal DNS resolution.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon Route 53 = AWS’s global DNS & domain management service.
            . Provides DNS hosting, domain registration, routing policies, failover.
            . Best practices → health checks, failover, latency/geolocation routing, private hosted zones.

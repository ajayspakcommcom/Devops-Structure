AWS Direct Connect – Key Pointers

    1. What is Direct Connect?
        . A dedicated private network connection between your on-premises datacenter/office and AWS VPC.
        . Bypasses the public internet → gives lower latency, higher bandwidth, and more consistent performance.
        . Often used for hybrid cloud and enterprise workloads.

    
    2. Why Use It?
        . Predictable performance vs internet VPN.
        . High bandwidth (1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps).
        . Secure → traffic doesn’t traverse the internet.
        . Cost-efficient for large data transfers (cheaper than internet egress charges).

    
    3. Core Features
        . Connection Types:
            . Dedicated Connection → physical connection provisioned by AWS.
            . Hosted Connection → provided via AWS Direct Connect Partners.
        . Virtual Interfaces (VIFs):
            . Private VIF → connect to VPC.
            . Public VIF → connect to AWS public services (S3, DynamoDB)
            . Transit VIF → connect to multiple VPCs via Transit Gateway.
        . Resiliency: Can be configured in redundant pairs for HA.
        . Encryption: Direct Connect itself doesn’t encrypt, but can combine with VPN (MACsec/IPSec) for encryption.

    4. Integration
        . Hybrid Cloud → Connect datacenter with AWS workloads.
        . Direct Connect Gateway → connect to multiple VPCs across Regions.
        . Works with Transit Gateway for hub-and-spoke networking.
        . Can be combined with Site-to-Site VPN for failover.

    5. Security
        . Private, dedicated connection (not internet).
        . Optionally encrypt with VPN over DX.
        . IAM policies + NACLs + SGs control access inside VPC.

    6. Cost Model
        . Two parts:
            . Port-hour charges (based on capacity: 1G, 10G, 100G).
            . Data transfer out (discounted compared to internet rates).
        . Example:
            . 1 Gbps port ~ $0.30/hour.
            . Data transfer to AWS → free.
            . Data transfer out → cheaper than internet egress.

    7. Industry Standards
       . Always deploy redundant DX connections (HA, different providers).
    ✅ . Use DX + VPN for encryption + failover.
    ✅ . Use Transit Gateway + DX Gateway for multi-VPC/Region connectivity.
    ✅ . Monitor with CloudWatch metrics (latency, throughput).
    ✅ . Combine with AWS Global Accelerator for global workloads.

    8. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Financial Services → low-latency trading platforms.
       . Healthcare → secure patient data transfer.
       . Media → high-volume video file transfers.
       . Enterprises → hybrid workloads (SAP, Oracle, VMware).
       . Government → compliance-driven private connectivity.

    9. Summary
        . AWS Direct Connect = dedicated private connection between on-prem & AWS.
            . Benefits → low latency, secure, predictable, cost-efficient at scale.
            . Industry best practices = redundant connections, combine with VPN for encryption, use DX Gateway with Transit Gateway for multi-VPC/Region setups.

AWS Global Accelerator – Key Pointers

    1. What is Global Accelerator?
        . A networking service that improves the availability and performance of global applications.
        . Provides two static anycast IP addresses → traffic automatically routes to the nearest healthy AWS endpoint.
        . Built on the AWS global network (not the public internet) → faster, more reliable.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Consistent low-latency connections for users worldwide.
        . Automatic failover to the next healthy region if one is down.
        . Static IPs → no need to change DNS when endpoints change.
        . Great for mission-critical, latency-sensitive apps.

    3. Core Features
        . Accelerated Traffic Routing: routes traffic via AWS global backbone network.
        . Health Checks: continuously checks endpoints (EC2, ALB, NLB, EIP).
        . Traffic Dialing: control % of traffic sent to each region (good for migrations or canary releases).
        . DDoS Protection: integrated with AWS Shield.
        . Endpoint Types Supported:
            . Application Load Balancer (ALB)
            . Network Load Balancer (NLB)
            . Elastic IP addresses
            . EC2 instances

    4. Security
        . Uses static anycast IPs (not changing with deployments).
        . Shield Standard DDoS protection included.
        . Works with WAF at the ALB level.
        . IAM integration for management.

    5. Cost Model
        . Fixed hourly fee → $0.025 per accelerator-hour (~$18/month).
        . Data transfer premium → per GB over the AWS backbone (varies by region).
        . Still cheaper and more reliable than sending traffic over the public internet for global apps.

    6. Industry Standards
        . Use Global Accelerator when:
            . You have global users (APIs, apps, SaaS).
            . Need multi-region HA with automatic failover.
            . Want static IPs instead of DNS-based routing.
        . Best Practices:
            . Combine with multi-region deployments (e.g., ALB in us-east-1 + eu-west-1).
            . Use traffic dials for controlled rollouts (blue/green).
            . Monitor with CloudWatch (latency, traffic, health status).
            . Use with Route 53 latency-based routing for hybrid setups.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . SaaS platforms → ensure low latency for customers worldwide.
        . APIs & Mobile Apps → reduce latency spikes for global users.
        . Gaming → connect players to the closest game server.
        . Financial services → real-time apps needing sub-100ms latency.
        . Healthcare/Government → compliance + high availability across regions.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Global Accelerator = global traffic director for apps.
            . Provides static IPs, low-latency routing, automatic failover.
            . Best for multi-region, mission-critical, latency-sensitive workloads.
            . Industry best practice → deploy multi-region + use Global Accelerator for resilience + performance.

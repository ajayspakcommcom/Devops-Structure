AWS Key Management Service (KMS) – Key Pointers

    1. What is KMS?
        . A fully managed encryption service.
        . Creates, manages, and controls cryptographic keys used to encrypt data across AWS.
        . Integrated with almost all AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.).

    2. Why Use It?
        . Encryption is required for security & compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, GDPR).
        . KMS simplifies this by:
           . Providing secure key storage.
           . Seamless integration with AWS services.
           . Automatic key rotation.
           . Centralized auditing of key usage.

    3. Core Features
        . Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) → full control over lifecycle & permissions.
        . AWS Managed Keys → created automatically per service (e.g., aws/s3).
        . Key Policies → JSON-based IAM-like rules for key access.
        . Automatic Rotation → yearly rotation for CMKs.
        . Encryption APIs → Encrypt, Decrypt, ReEncrypt, GenerateDataKey.
        . HSM-backed security → keys never leave FIPS 140-2 validated hardware.
        . Multi-Region Keys → replicate keys securely across AWS Regions.

    4. Security
        . Keys stored in hardware security modules (HSMs).
        . Integrated with IAM + Key Policies for fine-grained access.
        . Full audit trail in CloudTrail.
        . Envelope Encryption → KMS protects data keys, which encrypt large datasets.

    5. Cost Model
       . $1/month per Customer Managed Key (CMK).
       . $0.03 per 10,000 requests (Encrypt/Decrypt).
       . AWS Managed Keys = free.
       . Additional charges for cross-region/multi-region replication.


    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
       . Use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for sensitive workloads (gives you control).
       . Enable automatic rotation for CMKs.
       . Use multi-region keys for global apps.
       . Limit key usage with IAM + Key Policies.
       . Monitor usage with CloudTrail.
       . Use envelope encryption → generate data keys for bulk data encryption.
       . Use Secrets Manager/SSM Parameter Store with KMS for secure secret storage.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Financial services → PCI DSS card data encryption.
       . Healthcare → HIPAA patient data encryption.
       . E-commerce → Encrypt S3 objects (customer info, orders).
       . IoT → Device data encryption at scale.
       . SaaS apps → Tenant-level key separation (BYOK – Bring Your Own Key).

    8. Summary
        . AWS KMS = centralized key management & encryption service.
            . Provides secure, compliant, HSM-backed key storage.
            . Industry best practices → use CMKs, enable rotation, enforce key policies, log with CloudTrail, integrate with Secrets Manager.

AWS WAF & AWS Shield – Key Pointers

    1. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
        . Protects web applications from application-layer (Layer 7) attacks.
        . Blocks/filters malicious traffic before it reaches your apps.

        . Core Features
            . Define rules to allow/block/count requests.
            . Managed Rule Groups → preconfigured rules (SQLi, XSS, OWASP Top 10).
            . Custom Rules → based on IP, headers, URI, query string, geolocation.
            . Works with:
                . CloudFront
                . Application Load Balancer (ALB)
                . API Gateway
                . AppSync
            . Real-time monitoring via CloudWatch.

        . Use Cases
            . Prevent SQL injection, XSS, bot attacks.
            . Block requests from malicious IPs or countries.
            . Rate limiting (e.g., block >100 requests/sec from same IP).

    2. AWS Shield
        . Protects against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
        . Two versions:
            . Shield Standard → Free, always-on, protects against common L3/L4 DDoS (e.g., SYN floods, UDP reflection).
            . Shield Advanced → Paid, adds:
                . Enhanced protection for L3–L7 attacks.
                . 24/7 DDoS Response Team (DRT) support.
                . Cost protection against scaling charges during attacks.
                . Detailed attack diagnostics + advanced monitoring.

        . Use Cases
            . Protect public apps (websites, APIs, games) from DDoS.
            . Enterprise apps with compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA).
            . SaaS/multi-tenant platforms needing guaranteed uptime under attack.


    3. Security Model
        . WAF = Application layer (L7) protection.
        . Shield = Network/transport layer (L3/L4) + Advanced for L7.
        . Together they provide multi-layer defense:
           . Shield → absorbs massive DDoS floods.
           . WAF → blocks malicious web requests (SQLi, bots).
        
    4. Cost Model
        . WAF:
           . $5/month per web ACL.
           . $1/month per rule.
           . $0.60 per million requests processed.
        . Shield Standard → Free.
        . Shield Advanced → ~$3,000/month per organization.

    5. Industry Standards
        . Always enable Shield Standard (free, auto-on).
        . Use WAF managed rule groups for quick protection (SQLi, XSS, bot mitigation).
        . For high-risk apps → Shield Advanced + WAF together.
        . Use rate-based rules to mitigate brute force/bot traffic.
        . Monitor WAF metrics in CloudWatch for anomalies.

    6. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce → Block bots, fraud attempts, scrapers.
        . Banking/Finance → DDoS & L7 attack protection.
        . Healthcare → HIPAA compliance apps.
        . Gaming → Protect multiplayer APIs from floods.
        . SaaS platforms → Ensure uptime for global customers.

    7. Summary
        . AWS WAF → Protects against application-layer attacks (SQLi, XSS, bots).
        . AWS Shield → Protects against network-layer DDoS (L3/L4).
        . Best practice → use WAF + Shield together (multi-layer defense).
        . Shield Standard = free for all, Shield Advanced = enterprise-grade with DRT support + cost protection.

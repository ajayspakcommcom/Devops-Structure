Amazon Inspector – Key Pointers

    1. What is Amazon Inspector?
        . A fully managed vulnerability management service.
        . Continuously scans AWS workloads for:
            . Software vulnerabilities (CVEs)
            . Unintended network exposure
            . Security best practice violations
        . Covers EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Security audits are manual & slow — Inspector provides:
            . Continuous, automated scanning (not just one-time).
            . Integration with CVE database for real-time updates.
            . Prioritized findings based on exploitability + environment context.
        . Helps meet compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.).

    3. Core Features
        . Automated Scans → triggered by deployments, new images, config changes.
        . Context-Aware Scoring → ranks vulnerabilities based on severity, exposure, exploit availability.
        . Coverage:
            . EC2 → OS & application packages.
            . ECR → container images (pre-deployment scans).
            . Lambda → function code & dependencies.
        . Integration → Security Hub, EventBridge, CloudWatch, SNS.
        . Remediation guidance → suggested patches/config fixes.

    4. Security
        . Fully managed by AWS (no agents needed for ECR/Lambda).
        . EC2 uses AWS SSM Agent for scanning.
        . Findings encrypted with KMS.
        . IAM controls access to results.

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay per scanned resource:
            . EC2 instance → per instance-hour.
            . ECR image → per image scan.
            . Lambda → per function scan.
        . No upfront cost; scales with usage.

    6. Industry Standards
✅      . Enable Inspector for all accounts via AWS Organizations.
✅      . Integrate with ECR pipelines → scan images before deployment.
✅      . Use Security Hub to aggregate Inspector findings.
✅      . Prioritize remediation using Inspector risk scores.
✅      . Automate alerts → SNS/EventBridge for critical CVEs.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce → secure web apps by scanning EC2 + container images.
        . Financial services → compliance audits, PCI DSS checks.
        . Healthcare → protect patient systems (HIPAA workloads).
        . DevOps teams → integrate vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines.
        . SaaS providers → ensure secure containers before release.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon Inspector = continuous vulnerability management for AWS workloads.
            . Scans EC2, ECR, and Lambda for CVEs and misconfigurations.
            . Prioritizes risks with context-aware scoring.
            . Best practices → enable org-wide, integrate with CI/CD + Security Hub, automate alerts & patching.

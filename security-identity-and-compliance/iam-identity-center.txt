IAM Identity Center – Key Pointers

    1. What is IAM Identity Center?
        . A centralized identity and access management service for AWS.
        . Successor to AWS Single Sign-On (SSO).
        . Lets you manage user identities and permissions across multiple AWS accounts and applications.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Instead of managing IAM users in every AWS account, you:
            . Create/manage users once in Identity Center.
            . Assign them roles across AWS Organizations accounts.
            . Provide single sign-on to AWS Console + third-party apps (e.g., Salesforce, GitHub, Microsoft 365).
        . Simplifies multi-account AWS access + enforces least privilege.

    3. Core Features
        . Centralized User Management → Manage identities in Identity Center or connect with an external IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Active Directory).
        . Single Sign-On (SSO) → One login for multiple AWS accounts and business apps.
        . Fine-Grained Permissions → Built on IAM roles + permission sets.
        . Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support.
        . Audit & Monitoring → CloudTrail + CloudWatch integration.
        . SCIM → automated user/group provisioning from external IdPs.

    4. Security
        . Enforces MFA policies.
        . Integrates with corporate IdPs (SAML, OIDC).
        . IAM roles for fine-grained access to AWS resources.
        . Logs every login & action to CloudTrail for auditing.       

    5. Cost Model
        . Free service.
        . You only pay for the underlying resources (IAM roles, CloudTrail, etc.).

    6. Industry Standards
        . Use Identity Center + AWS Organizations → centralize multi-account access.
        . Integrate with Okta/Azure AD/ADFS for enterprise identity federation.
        . Define permission sets per role (developer, admin, auditor).
        . Require MFA for all privileged accounts.
        . Use CloudTrail to audit all identity activity.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Enterprises with many AWS accounts → centralize IAM.
        . DevOps teams → manage temporary access instead of long-lived IAM keys.
        . SaaS companies → give teams one login for AWS + third-party apps.
        . Regulated industries → enforce MFA + auditing across accounts.
        . Hybrid cloud → integrate on-prem AD with AWS.

    8. Summary
        . IAM Identity Center = AWS’s centralized identity & SSO solution.
            . Successor to AWS SSO.
            . Provides single sign-on, MFA, and centralized permission management across AWS + external apps.
            . Best practices → integrate with corporate IdP, enforce MFA, use permission sets, audit with CloudTrail.

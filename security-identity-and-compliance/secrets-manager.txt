AWS Secrets Manager – Key Pointers

    1. What is Secrets Manager?
        . A fully managed service to store, manage, and rotate secrets like:
            . Database credentials
            . API keys
            . OAuth tokens
            . Custom application secrets
        . Integrates with AWS services + your applications.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Hardcoding secrets in code/env files = high risk.
        . Secrets Manager solves this by:
            . Secure storage with encryption (KMS).
            . Automatic rotation (built-in for RDS, Aurora, Redshift, and custom Lambda rotations).
            . Auditing & monitoring.
            . Secure retrieval via API/SDK.

    3. Core Features
       . Encryption → All secrets encrypted at rest with AWS KMS.
       . Versioning → Supports multiple versions of a secret.
       . Automatic Rotation → Configurable rotation policies (e.g., rotate DB password every 30 days).
       . Access Control → Fine-grained via IAM policies.
       . Audit Logging → All API calls logged in CloudTrail.
       . Cross-Region Replication → Store secrets globally.

    4. Security
       . Secrets never stored in plaintext (always encrypted).
       . IAM controls who/what can read or update secrets.
       . Integration with VPC + PrivateLink for private access.

    5. Cost Model
       . $0.40 per secret per month.
       . $0.05 per 10,000 API calls.
       . Cross-region replication adds extra charges.

    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
✅     . Store all credentials & API keys in Secrets Manager (not in code).
✅     . Use automatic rotation for databases (Aurora, RDS, Redshift).
✅     . Use resource-based policies to limit which apps can access secrets.
✅     . Enable CloudTrail monitoring for secret access logs.
✅     . Use cross-region replication for global workloads.
✅     . Rotate application secrets using Lambda custom rotation functions.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Databases → RDS/Aurora passwords auto-rotated.
        . DevOps pipelines → Fetch secrets during CI/CD builds.
        . Microservices → Store API tokens securely.
        . Multi-cloud apps → Manage credentials across AWS & external APIs.
        . Finance/Healthcare → Compliance with regulations requiring secret rotation & encryption.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Secrets Manager = secure storage & automatic rotation for secrets.
            . Encrypted with KMS, integrates with AWS + external services.
            . Industry best practices → enable rotation, enforce IAM-based access, log with CloudTrail, replicate across regions.

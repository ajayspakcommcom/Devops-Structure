Amazon GuardDuty – Key Pointers

    1. What is GuardDuty?
        . A managed threat detection service that continuously monitors AWS accounts, workloads, and data for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
        . Uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence feeds.
        . Works without installing agents → analyzes data from AWS logs.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Detects threats early (crypto-mining, compromised IAM, malware).
        . Helps meet security compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO, SOC2).
        . Reduces need for a full SIEM setup in smaller orgs.
        . Integrates into Security Hub + automated response pipelines.

    3. Core Features
        . Data Sources Monitored:
            . VPC Flow Logs (network traffic patterns).
            . CloudTrail (API calls, IAM usage).
            . DNS Logs (suspicious domain queries).
            . EKS Audit Logs (Kubernetes threats).
            . S3 Data Access Logs (exfiltration attempts).
        . Findings:
            . Compromised IAM credentials.
            . Malicious EC2 behavior (botnets, crypto-mining).
            . S3 bucket data exfiltration.
            . Recon attempts from attackers.
        . Severity Levels: Low, Medium, High (prioritized alerts).
        . Integration:
            . Security Hub (central view).
            . EventBridge (automated responses → isolate EC2, rotate keys).

    4. Security Model
        . Runs entirely within AWS (no agents).
        . Uses AWS’s own threat intel feeds + partner feeds.
        . Findings encrypted (KMS).
        . IAM policies control access to results.

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay-per-GB of log data analyzed:
          . VPC Flow Logs, DNS, CloudTrail, EKS audit logs, S3 events.
        . No upfront cost.
        . Free 30-day trial per account.

    6. Industry Standards
        . Enable GuardDuty across all accounts via AWS Organizations.
    ✅  . Send findings to Security Hub for unified dashboards.
    ✅  . Automate responses → e.g., block suspicious IP with WAF or isolate EC2 with Lambda.
    ✅  . Regularly review findings & integrate into SOC playbooks.
    ✅  . Use multi-region GuardDuty for global coverage.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Financial services → detect insider threats, fraud.
        . Healthcare → compliance-driven anomaly detection.
        . E-commerce → prevent account takeover + data theft.
        . Government → monitor for advanced persistent threats (APT).
        . DevOps → detect misconfigured IAM roles or open S3 buckets.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon GuardDuty = threat detection & continuous monitoring.
            . Monitors AWS logs for malicious/unauthorized activity.
            . Provides ML-driven, prioritized findings.
            . Best practices → enable org-wide, integrate with Security Hub + EventBridge, automate remediation.

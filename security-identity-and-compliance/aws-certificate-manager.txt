AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) – Key Pointers

    1. What is ACM?
        . A managed service to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates.
        . Supports both public certificates (for internet-facing apps) and private certificates (for internal apps).
        . Automates renewals → no downtime from expired certs.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Certificates are critical for HTTPS, secure APIs, and compliance.
        . Manual management = error-prone → ACM provides:
            . Free public certs for AWS resources.
            . Auto-renewal & deployment.
            . Integration with AWS load balancers, CloudFront, API Gateway, App Runner, etc.

    3. Core Features
        . Public Certificates → Free SSL/TLS certs (issued by Amazon CA).
        . Private CA (ACM PCA) → Create private PKI for internal services.
        . Auto-Renewal → No manual cert renewal needed.
        . Deployment Targets:
            . Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB/CLB)
            . CloudFront
            . API Gateway / App Runner / App Mesh
            . EC2 via Elastic Beanstalk
        . Validation Options:
            . DNS validation (preferred)
            . Email validation

    4. Security
        . Certificates managed by ACM are stored securely.
        . Private CA supports custom certificate hierarchies.
        . IAM policies restrict who can request/export certs.
        . Certificates use RSA 2048/4096 or Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

    5. Cost Model
        . Public Certificates → Free.
        . Private CA → Paid (per CA + per certificate issued).
        . You pay only if you use ACM Private CA, not for free ACM public certs.

    6. Industry Standards
        . Always use ACM certs for AWS load balancers, CloudFront, API Gateway.
✅      . Prefer DNS validation → automated renewals.
✅      . Use ACM Private CA for internal apps/microservices.
✅      . Rotate certs automatically with ACM instead of manual OpenSSL certs.
✅      . Use IAM policies to restrict cert issuance & export.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce / SaaS → secure websites & APIs with HTTPS.
        . Enterprises → internal PKI with ACM Private CA.
        . Microservices → mutual TLS (mTLS) between services.
        . CloudFront/ALB apps → free SSL with global distribution.
        . Regulated industries → custom cert hierarchies via Private CA.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) = free SSL/TLS certs for AWS resources.
            . Automates provisioning, renewal, and deployment.
            . Public certs = free, Private CA = paid.
            . Industry best practices → always use DNS validation, integrate ACM certs with ELB/CloudFront/API Gateway, use ACM PCA for internal PKI.

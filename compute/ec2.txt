Amazon EC2 – Key Pointers

    a. What is EC2?
        1. Virtual servers in the cloud.
        2. You choose OS, CPU, memory, storage, networking.
        3. Fully customizable, pay-as-you-go compute.
        4. Foundation of most AWS workloads.

    b. Instance Types (Choose Based on Workload)
        1. General Purpose (t, m series) → Web servers, dev/test.
        2. Compute Optimized (c series) → High CPU tasks (gaming, data processing).
        3. Memory Optimized (r, x series) → Databases, caching, analytics.
        4. Storage Optimized (i, d series) → High IOPS workloads, NoSQL, data warehousing.
        5. Accelerated Computing (p, g series) → ML/AI, GPUs, HPC.
        6. Burstable (t2, t3, t4g) → Low-cost apps that need occasional CPU burst.

    c. Pricing Models
        1. On-Demand → pay per second/hour (flexible, no commitment).
        2. Reserved Instances → 1–3 year commitment, up to 72% cheaper.
        3. Savings Plans → flexible compute discount.
        4. Spot Instances → up to 90% cheaper, but can be terminated anytime.
        5. Dedicated Hosts/Instances → compliance, license-bound apps.

    d. Storage Options
        1. EBS (Elastic Block Store) → persistent block storage, survives reboots.
        2. Instance Store → temporary, tied to instance lifecycle.
        3. Attach multiple EBS volumes per EC2.

    e. Networking
        1. Placed inside VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
        2. ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces) for multi-NIC setups.
        3. Elastic IPs for static public IP.
        4. Security Groups (firewall rules at instance level).
        5. NACLs (subnet-level firewall).

    f. Scaling & Availability
        1. Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) → scale up/down automatically.
        2. Load Balancers (ELB/ALB/NLB) → distribute traffic.
        3. Deploy across multiple AZs for HA (high availability).

    g. Security
        1. Key pairs (SSH/RDP) for login.
        2. IAM roles for permissions (never hardcode keys).
        3. Security Groups for inbound/outbound control.
        4. SSM (Systems Manager Session Manager) for secure shell access (no SSH keys needed).

    h. Monitoring
        1. CloudWatch metrics (CPU, disk, network).
        2. CloudTrail for API activity.
        3. SSM Agent for patching & inventory.

    i. Industry Standards
    ✅ 1. Always deploy in private subnets with Bastion/SSM for secure access.
    ✅ 2. Use Auto Scaling + Load Balancer for production.
    ✅ 3. Encrypt EBS volumes with KMS.
    ✅ 4. Apply patch management via Systems Manager.
    ✅ 5. Monitor with CloudWatch + CloudTrail.
    ✅ 6. Use Reserved/Savings Plans for predictable workloads, Spot for batch jobs.

    j. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        1. Web Hosting → LAMP/MEAN stack on EC2.
        2. Databases → Self-managed DBs (though RDS is preferred).
        3. Application Servers → Node.js, Java, Python apps.
        4. Batch Processing → Spot instances for cost savings.
        5. Legacy Apps → Windows workloads with licensing needs.

    k. Summary:
        EC2 = AWS’s core compute service.
            1. Flexible, scalable, secure virtual machines.
            2. Industry best practices = VPC + private subnet + load balancer + autoscaling + encryption + monitoring.

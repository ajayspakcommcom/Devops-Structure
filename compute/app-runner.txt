AWS App Runner – Key Pointers

    1. What is App Runner?
        . A fully managed service to build and run containerized web applications and APIs at scale.
        . You just provide source code (GitHub/CodeCommit) or a container image (ECR) → App Runner handles:
            . Container build
            . Deployment
            . Load balancing
            . Scaling (up & down, including to zero)

    2. Why Use It?
       . No need to manage EC2, ECS, EKS, VPCs, ALBs.
       . Focus on app code → AWS handles the infra.
       . Great for teams that want serverless-like simplicity with container flexibility.

    3. How It Works
        . Two starting points:
            . Source code (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) → App Runner builds a container using AWS-provided buildpacks.
            . Prebuilt container image (ECR) → App Runner just runs it.
        . Then App Runner:
            . Deploys behind an HTTPS endpoint (ACM certificate managed automatically).
            . Autoscaling based on traffic (scale to zero when idle).
            . Provides logging & monitoring out-of-the-box.

    4. Features
        . Autoscaling → scales instances up/down automatically.
        . HTTPS by default → managed SSL certs.
        . Private ECR support → secure image hosting.
        . VPC Connector → connect to RDS, ElastiCache, etc.
        . Observability → integrated with CloudWatch logs & metrics.

    5. Security
        . IAM roles attached to service for resource access.
        . ACM SSL certificates auto-provisioned.
        . Runs in an AWS-managed VPC (optionally connect to your VPC).
        . All traffic encrypted (in transit + optional at rest).

    6. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
           . vCPU & memory usage per second (only while app is running).
           . Requests handled.
        . Example (us-east-1):
           . $0.064 vCPU-hour.
           . $0.007 GB-hour.
           . First 1M requests free → $1 per additional 1M.
        . Scales to zero → saves cost when idle.

    7. Industry Standards
       . Use source-based deployments for small apps, ECR-based for containerized microservices.
    ✅ . Integrate with CI/CD (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions) for automated builds/deployments.
    ✅ . Use VPC Connectors to securely access DBs inside private subnets.
    ✅ . Monitor with CloudWatch + set up alarms.
    ✅ . Use environment variables + IAM roles for secrets (never hardcode).

    8. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Startups/SMBs → Fast way to deploy APIs without DevOps.
        . Web Apps & APIs → Node.js, Django, Spring Boot apps.
        . Internal Services → Microservices behind a secure HTTPS endpoint.
        . Event Processing → REST endpoints for webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub events).
        . Prototypes/MVPs → Deploy quickly, then scale later.

    Summary:
        AWS App Runner = serverless container app platform.
            . Run web apps & APIs directly from code or container.
            . Scales automatically, HTTPS out-of-the-box, no infra management.
            . Industry best practices: CI/CD + VPC Connector + IAM roles + CloudWatch monitoring.

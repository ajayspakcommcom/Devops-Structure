AWS Global View – Key Pointers

    1. What is AWS Global View?
        . A feature in the AWS Management Console that gives you a single-pane-of-glass view of resources across all AWS Regions in your account (or AWS Organizations).
        . Helps enterprises with multi-region visibility without logging into each region separately.

    2. What It Shows
        . Active resources across Regions:
           . EC2 instances
           . VPCs
           . S3 buckets
           . RDS instances
           . IAM resources (Org level)
        . Lets you filter by:
           . Service
           . Region
           . Account (if using AWS Organizations)

    3. Why Use It?
        . Operational visibility → track all resources across multiple regions.
        . Cost optimization → identify unused resources left running in other regions.
        . Compliance & security → detect resources outside approved regions.
        . Multi-account strategy → easier management for enterprises using AWS Organizations.

    4. Integration
        . AWS Organizations → manage multiple accounts.
        . CloudWatch / CloudTrail → monitor + audit across regions.
        . Cost Explorer → combined with global view for cost tracking.

    5. Security
        . Access controlled by IAM policies.
        . Global View doesn’t grant new permissions → it shows resources based on what the user already has access to.

    6. Industry Standards
✅      . Enterprises enable Global View for Ops teams to manage global infra.
✅      . Use with Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations to block resource creation outside allowed regions.
✅      . Combine with AWS Config Aggregator for compliance reporting across regions.
✅      . Use Global View dashboards for cost + security audits.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Global Enterprises → manage hundreds of resources across US, EU, Asia regions.
        . Finance/Healthcare → ensure compliance (e.g., only allowed regions).
        . Ops Teams → detect orphaned EC2/RDS instances.
        . Cost Management → shut down unused global resources.

    ✅8. Summary:
        AWS Global View = unified multi-region resource dashboard.
            . Shows resources across all AWS regions/accounts.
            . Helps with visibility, compliance, cost, and security management.
            . Industry best practice = use Global View + AWS Config + SCPs for enterprise governance.

Amazon Lightsail – Key Pointers

    a. What is Lightsail?
        1. A simplified VPS (Virtual Private Server) service on AWS.
        2. Provides bundled resources (compute + storage + network) at a fixed monthly price.
        3. Designed for developers, startups, and SMBs who want less complexity than EC2.

    b. Features
        1. Pre-configured blueprints: WordPress, LAMP, Node.js, Django, etc.
        2. Fixed monthly pricing (starts around $5/month).
        3. Includes compute, SSD storage, data transfer, static IP, DNS management.
        4. One-click scaling to larger plans.
        5. Supports containers (Lightsail Container Service) and databases (Lightsail Managed DB).

    c. Comparison with EC2
        | Feature         | Lightsail               | EC2                         |
        | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
        | **Ease of Use** | Very simple, few clicks | Complex, full customization |
        | **Pricing**     | Fixed bundles           | Pay-per-use, flexible       |
        | **Networking**  | Basic firewall          | Advanced (VPC, SG, NACLs)   |
        | **Scaling**     | Manual or limited       | Auto Scaling Groups         |
        | **Use Case**    | Small apps, blogs, PoCs | Enterprise-grade workloads  |

    d. Networking
        1. Static IP included.
        2. Basic firewall rules (allow ports).
        3. Custom domain setup with Lightsail DNS or Route53.

    e. Security
        1. Default SSH key pairs for Linux.
        2. Password + RDP for Windows instances.
        3. Simpler than EC2’s IAM + SG/NACL model.

    f. Backup & Snapshots
        1. Supports instance snapshots (manual + scheduled).
        2. Snapshots can be exported to EC2 for advanced scaling.

    g. Cost Model
        1. Fixed bundles (CPU + RAM + SSD + transfer).
        2. Example (Linux/Unix instance, us-east-1):
            a. $5 → 1 vCPU, 512MB RAM, 20GB SSD, 1TB transfer.
            b. $20 → 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD, 4TB transfer.
        3. Additional charges for extra data transfer, snapshots, static IPs beyond free tier.

    h. Industry Standards
        1. Use Lightsail for small-scale workloads:
            a. Websites (WordPress, blogs, small e-commerce).
            b. Development/staging environments.
            c. Lightweight containerized apps.
              1. Use EC2/EKS/ECS for production-grade, scalable workloads.
              2. Snapshot & migrate to EC2 when scaling beyond Lightsail limits.

    i. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        1. Startups: Quick MVP deployment.
        2. SMBs: WordPress, CRM, ERP systems.
        3. Developers: Testing apps without EC2 complexity.
        4. Education: Student projects, training.

    j. Summary:
        1. Lightsail = easy VPS service with fixed pricing.
        2. Great for simple apps, blogs, PoCs, SMBs.
        3. Enterprises usually start with Lightsail, then migrate to EC2/EKS for scaling.

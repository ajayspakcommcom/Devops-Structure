AWS Batch – Key Pointers

    1. What is AWS Batch?
        . A fully managed batch computing service.
        . Runs hundreds to thousands of batch jobs efficiently.
        . Automatically provisions the right compute (EC2, Spot, or Fargate) based on your workload.
        . Ideal for scientific computing, ML training, simulations, video rendering, ETL jobs.


    2. Core Components
        . Jobs → The work units (a shell script, ML model training, video encoding, etc.).
        . Job Definitions → Blueprint with job parameters (Docker image, vCPUs, memory).
        . Job Queues → Where jobs wait until resources are available.
        . Compute Environments → Managed set of compute (EC2 On-Demand, Spot, or Fargate) that Batch uses to run jobs.

    3. Execution Model
        . Jobs typically run inside Docker containers.
        . Batch pulls images from ECR/Docker Hub.
        . Can scale from single vCPU jobs → thousands of parallel jobs.

    4. Integration
        . S3 → Input/output data.
        . CloudWatch Logs → Monitoring job output.
        . IAM → Role-based access for jobs.
        . Step Functions → Orchestrating workflows.
        . ECS/Fargate → Runs the containers.

    5. Scaling
        . Batch auto-scales the compute environment.
        . Supports EC2 Spot Instances for 70–90% cost savings.
        . Can run on Fargate (serverless containers) → no EC2 management.

    6. Security
        . Jobs run with IAM roles → least privilege.
        . Data in transit (TLS) + at rest (S3/EBS/KMS) encryption.
        . Private networking via VPC integration.

    7. Monitoring
        . CloudWatch → metrics, job status.
        . EventBridge → trigger alerts on job completion/failure.
        . CloudTrail → logs API activity.

    8. Cost Model
        . No extra charge for AWS Batch service itself.
        . Pay only for compute (EC2/Spot/Fargate) + storage.
        . Spot pricing often used for cost efficiency.

    9. Industry Standards
        . Use Spot Instances for non-critical, retryable workloads (cheapest).
        . Use On-Demand/Reserved for critical jobs.
        . Store inputs/outputs in S3.
        . Keep job definitions modular → 1 container = 1 job type.
        . Use CloudWatch + EventBridge for monitoring & automation.
        . Tag jobs/resources for cost tracking.

    10. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Media & Entertainment → Video rendering, transcoding.
        . Finance → Risk analysis, Monte Carlo simulations.
        . Healthcare/Research → Genomic analysis, ML training.
        . Big Data/ETL → Batch extract-transform-load pipelines.
        . Engineering → Simulations, CAD workloads.

    Summary:
        AWS Batch = fully managed batch processing at any scale.
            . Runs containerized jobs.
            . Uses EC2, Spot, or Fargate automatically.
            . Industry best practice = S3 + Batch + CloudWatch + Spot for cost savings.

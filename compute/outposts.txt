AWS Outposts – Key Pointers

    1. What is Outposts?
        . A fully managed service that brings AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises locations.
        . Basically → AWS installs real AWS racks/servers in your data center.
        . You run AWS services (EC2, EBS, S3, RDS, EKS, ECS, etc.) locally with the same APIs, consoles, and tools as the AWS cloud.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Low latency → Apps that require microsecond latency to users/equipment.
        . Data residency & compliance → Keep data in country/on-prem.
        . Hybrid cloud strategy → Seamless AWS + on-prem integration.
        . Local processing → Real-time analytics, IoT, factory, healthcare.

    3. Deployment Models
        . Outposts Rack → Full 42U rack delivered, installed by AWS.
        . Outposts Server → Smaller form factor (1U/2U) for branch offices/edge sites.

    4. Services Available on Outposts
        . Compute: EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda.
        . Storage: EBS, S3 (local buckets).
        . Database: RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
        . Analytics & ML: EMR, SageMaker (limited).
        . Other: VPC networking, IAM, CloudFormation.
        (Not all AWS services are available — only those supported for Outposts.)

    5. Networking
        . Connected to parent AWS Region via AWS Direct Connect / VPN.
        . Local workloads run on Outposts hardware but can still call other AWS services.
        . Fully integrated with VPC, IAM, CloudWatch.

    6. Security
        . Same AWS security model (IAM, KMS, encryption).
        . Hardware delivered, installed, and managed by AWS (you don’t physically manage servers).
        . Data stays on-prem if required.

    7. Monitoring
        . Integrated with CloudWatch & CloudTrail.
        . AWS manages patching, updates, and monitoring of infrastructure.


    8. Cost Model
        . Subscription-based → You commit to hardware capacity (3–5 years).
        . Pay for:
           . Hardware capacity (EC2, EBS, S3).
           . Managed services on Outposts.
        . Pricing depends on instance types/storage ordered.
        . High upfront cost → Designed for enterprises.

    9. Industry Standards
       . Use Outposts when workloads need <10ms latency to on-prem systems.
    ✅ . Use for data residency requirements (finance, healthcare, government).
    ✅ . Integrate with Region services for hybrid workloads.
    ✅ . Use Outposts + AWS Backup + DRS for compliance & DR.
    ✅ . Monitor via CloudWatch just like cloud workloads.

    10. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Healthcare → Keep sensitive patient data local.
       . Telecom → 5G applications at the edge.
       . Manufacturing → Real-time factory automation.
       . Finance/Government → Data residency compliance.
       . Retail → Low-latency in-store apps.

    11. Summary:
        AWS Outposts = AWS in your data center.
            . Runs EC2, EBS, S3, RDS locally.
            . Managed by AWS, connected to parent Region.
            . Best for low-latency, compliance, hybrid workloads.

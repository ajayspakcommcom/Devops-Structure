EC2 Image Builder – Key Pointers

    1. What is it?
        . A fully managed service that automates the creation, testing, and distribution of golden images for EC2 and on-premises.
        . Works for both:
           . Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for EC2.
           . Container images (Docker/ECR).

    2. Why Use It?
        . Manual AMI building (customizing OS, patching, hardening) is error-prone.
        . Image Builder ensures consistent, secure, and up-to-date images.
        . Integrates with CI/CD pipelines → updated images auto-built & distributed.

    3. Workflow
        . Image Pipeline → defines the automation process (build + test + distribute).
        . Recipe → defines the image components:
           . Base OS (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows).
           . Additional software (e.g., Nginx, Java, security agents).
        . Build → EC2 Image Builder launches a build instance, installs components, creates a new AMI/container.
        . Test → Run automated tests to validate (boot time, app version, security).
        . Distribute → AMI pushed to Regions/accounts or container image → ECR.

    4. Key Features
        . Automated OS patching → ensures security compliance.
        . Versioning → track image versions.
        . Multi-Region distribution → replicate AMIs across Regions.
        . Integration with Systems Manager (SSM) → run custom build/test scripts.
        . CloudWatch Logs → monitor build/test runs.

    5. Security
        . Images automatically hardened (patches applied).
        . Encrypted AMIs/EBS snapshots with KMS keys.
        . IAM roles control build/test permissions.

    6. Cost Model
        . EC2 Image Builder itself is free.
        . You only pay for:
            . EC2 instances used during build/test.
            . EBS storage for images.
            . S3/ECR for storing outputs.

    7. Industry Standards
        . Use Image Builder pipelines to automate monthly OS patch AMIs.
        . Store golden AMIs in a central account → share across accounts.
        . Always run tests (security scanning, CIS benchmarks) before publishing.
        . Encrypt all AMIs with KMS.
        . Integrate with CI/CD (CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions).


    8. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Enterprises: Maintain golden AMIs for compliance & security.
        . DevOps teams: Bake application dependencies into base images.
        . Container teams: Build & distribute Docker images to ECR.
        . Multi-account setups: Distribute approved images across all environments.

    9. Summary:
        EC2 Image Builder = automated image factory.
            . Creates secure, up-to-date AMIs & container images.
            . Industry best practice = use for golden images, automated patching, compliance.
            . Free service → only infra costs apply.

AWS Organizations – Key Pointers

    1. What is AWS Organizations?
        . A centralized management service for multiple AWS accounts.
        . Lets you:
            . Consolidate billing.
            . Apply policies (SCPs) across accounts.
            . Manage accounts in Organizational Units (OUs).
        . Essential for enterprise-scale AWS setups.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Enterprises rarely run everything in a single account → they separate workloads for security, billing, compliance, isolation.
        . Organizations provides:
            . Single place to manage accounts.
            . Guardrails to enforce compliance (SCPs).
            . Centralized governance across business units.

    3. Core Features
        . Account Management → Create and invite AWS accounts.
        . Organizational Units (OUs) → Group accounts (e.g., Prod, Dev, Finance).
        . Service Control Policies (SCPs) → Restrict what services/accounts can do (e.g., deny creating internet gateways).
        . Consolidated Billing → One bill for all accounts, volume discounts.
        . Integration with:
            . AWS Config (compliance across org).
            . GuardDuty (org-wide threat detection).
            . Security Hub (org-wide security posture).
            . IAM Identity Center (central identity + access).

    4. Security
        . SCPs act as permission boundaries → even admins in child accounts cannot bypass them.
        . Root account should only be used for org management.
        . Audit access with CloudTrail.

    5. Cost Model
        . Free service.
        . You only pay for resources/accounts being used.

    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
    ✅ . Use a multi-account strategy → separate prod, dev, security, shared services.
    ✅ . Organize accounts in OUs by environment or business unit.
    ✅ . Apply SCPs to enforce guardrails (e.g., restrict regions, block IAM wildcard policies).
    ✅ . Enable organization-wide AWS Config, GuardDuty, Security Hub.
    ✅ . Use IAM Identity Center for org-wide SSO.
    ✅ . Enable CloudTrail at org level.
    ✅ . Use Consolidated Billing to optimize costs.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
       . Enterprises → multiple accounts per department, managed centrally.
       . Regulated industries → enforce compliance guardrails with SCPs.
       . Multi-team SaaS providers → isolate workloads per customer/team.
       . Finance/Healthcare/Gov → org-wide security posture monitoring.
       . Startups scaling up → gradually add accounts as teams grow.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Organizations = multi-account governance + billing service.
            . Provides OUs, SCPs, centralized security/compliance integration.
            . Industry best practices → multi-account strategy, SCP guardrails, org-wide Config/GuardDuty, IAM Identity Center for SSO.

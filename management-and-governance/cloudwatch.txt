Amazon CloudWatch – Key Pointers

    1. What is CloudWatch?
        . A monitoring and observability service for AWS and applications.
        . Collects and tracks:
            . Metrics (CPU, memory, latency, custom app metrics)
            . Logs (application/system logs)
            . Events (real-time system events)
            . Alarms & Dashboards for alerting and visualization.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Provides real-time visibility into AWS resources & applications.
        . Helps with performance tuning, troubleshooting, and cost optimization.
        . Integrates with automation (EventBridge, Lambda, Auto Scaling).

    3. Core Features
        . CloudWatch Metrics → Built-in + custom metrics.
        . CloudWatch Alarms → Trigger actions (e.g., scale EC2, send SNS alerts).
        . CloudWatch Logs → Centralized logging, query with Logs Insights.
        . CloudWatch Events / EventBridge → Respond to system/application events.
        . CloudWatch Dashboards → Custom views for monitoring apps.=
        . CloudWatch Synthetics → Automated canary tests for API/website uptime.
        . CloudWatch Contributor Insights → Analyze traffic contributors (e.g., top IPs hitting API).
        . CloudWatch Application Insights → Detect issues in enterprise workloads.

    4. Security
        . IAM policies control who can view/edit dashboards/logs.
        . Logs encrypted at rest with KMS.
        . Can restrict access with VPC endpoints.

    5. Cost Model
        . Free Tier: 10 custom metrics + 5GB logs + 3 dashboards/month.
        . Paid:
            . $0.30 per custom metric/month.
            . $0.50 per GB logs ingested, $0.03 per GB archived.
            . $0.10 per alarm/month.
            . Dashboards, synthetics, and logs queries billed separately.

    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
✅      . Monitor all critical resources (EC2, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).
✅      . Set CloudWatch Alarms for performance thresholds (CPU > 80%, high error rate).
✅      . Use Logs Insights to query structured/unstructured logs.
✅      . Centralize logs from multiple accounts via CloudWatch Logs + AWS Organizations.
✅      . Use dashboards per environment (dev/stage/prod).
✅      . Integrate alarms with SNS, PagerDuty, Slack for alerting.
✅      . Automate remediation with EventBridge → Lambda/SSM.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce → Monitor API latency, error rates, checkout pipeline health.
        . Financial services → Alert on unusual API activity or latency spikes.
        . Healthcare → Ensure HIPAA-compliant workloads meet SLAs.
        . Gaming → Monitor player session counts, backend servers.
        . DevOps → Centralized logs for debugging + CI/CD integration.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon CloudWatch = AWS’s monitoring, logging, and observability hub.
          . Provides metrics, logs, events, dashboards, alarms.
          . Best practices → set alarms on critical metrics, centralize logs, use dashboards per environment, integrate with EventBridge for automation.

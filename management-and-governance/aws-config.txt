AWS Config – Key Pointers

    1. What is AWS Config?
        . A continuous monitoring and compliance service.
        . Tracks resource configurations over time and checks them against rules & compliance standards.
        . Helps answer: “What resources exist? How are they configured? Are they compliant?”

    2. Why Use It?
        . Provides visibility → full inventory of AWS resources.
        . Detects drift from security/compliance baselines.
        . Helps with auditing (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO, etc.).
        . Enables automatic remediation when resources violate policies.

    3. Core Features
        . Resource Inventory → complete list of AWS resources (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, etc.).
        . Configuration History → track changes over time.
        . Compliance Rules:
        . AWS managed rules (e.g., S3 buckets must not be public).
            . Custom rules (using Lambda).
            . Conformance Packs → pre-packaged rules for compliance standards (PCI DSS, CIS, HIPAA).
        . Remediation → auto-fix issues (e.g., encrypt unencrypted EBS volumes).
        . Multi-Account/Multi-Region Aggregation → centralize compliance across enterprise.

    4. Security
        . Fully integrated with IAM for access control.
        . All activity logged in CloudTrail.
        . Resource data encrypted (KMS).

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay per:
            . Configuration item recorded ($0.003 per item).
            . Active AWS Config rule ($0.001 per evaluation).
        . Free tier: 100,000 configuration items recorded per month (first year).

    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
        . Enable AWS Config at org-level (via AWS Organizations).
    ✅  . Apply Conformance Packs (CIS, PCI, HIPAA) to enforce compliance.
    ✅  . Automate remediation with SSM documents.
     ✅ . Regularly audit S3 public access, IAM over-permissive policies, unencrypted EBS/RDS.
     ✅ . Use Config Aggregator for central visibility across regions/accounts.
     ✅ . Store Config data in S3 + Athena/QuickSight for custom reporting.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Financial services → prove PCI DSS compliance.
        . Healthcare → HIPAA audits (encryption, access controls)
        . Government → NIST/FedRAMP compliance validation.
        . Enterprises → manage multi-account compliance.
        . DevOps → track config drift between dev/staging/prod.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Config = compliance + configuration tracking service.
            . Provides inventory, history, rules, remediation.
            . Best practices → enable org-wide, apply conformance packs, auto-remediate, store history in S3 for audits.

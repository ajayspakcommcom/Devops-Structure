AWS Systems Manager – Key Pointers

    1. What is Systems Manager?
        . A management and operations service that provides a unified interface to view and control AWS resources and on-prem servers.
        . Helps automate patching, configuration, compliance, and operational tasks.
        . Often called the Swiss army knife of AWS operations.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Without SSM, you’d need multiple tools for patching, automation, and compliance.
        . SSM provides:
            . Centralized operations hub for AWS + on-prem.
            . Automation of repetitive tasks (patching, deployments).
            . Secure remote management (no SSH needed).
            . Compliance reporting for enterprises.

    3. Core Features
        . Session Manager → Secure shell access to EC2/on-prem (no SSH keys, no open ports).
        . Run Command → Execute commands across fleets (e.g., update software).
        . Patch Manager → Automate patching for OS + applications.
        . Automation Documents (SSM Docs) → Automate complex workflows.
        . Parameter Store → Store config data & secrets (integrates with KMS).
        . OpsCenter → Centralized view of operational issues.
        . Inventory → Collect system metadata (apps, config, patches).
        . State Manager → Enforce desired configuration state.
        . Compliance → Ensure resources follow security baselines.

    4. Security
        . IAM policies control who can access/run SSM features.
        . All sessions & commands logged to CloudTrail + CloudWatch Logs.
        . Encryption of parameters/secrets with KMS.
        . No need for SSH keys or bastion hosts → reduces attack surface.

    5. Cost Model
        . Many SSM features are free (Session Manager, Run Command, Parameter Store [standard]).
        . Paid features:
            . Advanced Parameter Store ($0.05 per advanced param/month).
            . OpsCenter, Patch Manager, Compliance checks ($0.006–$0.01 per resource).
            . Automation executions ($0.002 per step).

    6. Industry Standards & Best Practices
✅      . Use Session Manager instead of SSH → more secure & auditable.
✅      . Store app configs in Parameter Store (encrypted with KMS).
✅      . Automate patching with Patch Manager.
✅      . Use State Manager for baseline compliance (e.g., CIS, PCI DSS).
✅      . Centralize OpsCenter + CloudWatch Alarms for issue tracking.
✅      . Aggregate SSM data across accounts via AWS Organizations.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . DevOps → Automate deployments, patch servers.
        . Security teams → Secure shell access + auditing.
        . Enterprises → Compliance enforcement across thousands of servers.
        . Hybrid IT → Manage on-prem + AWS with one tool.
        . SaaS providers → Parameter Store for multi-tenant configs/secrets.

    8. Summary
        . AWS Systems Manager = operations + management hub for AWS & hybrid environments.
            . Provides Session Manager, Patch Manager, Run Command, Parameter Store, Automation, Compliance.
            . Best practices → replace SSH with Session Manager, automate patching, store configs in Parameter Store, enforce compliance with State Manager.

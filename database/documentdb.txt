Amazon DocumentDB – Key Pointers

    1. What is DocumentDB?
        . A fully managed document database service.
        . Designed to be MongoDB-compatible (works with MongoDB drivers & APIs).
        . Stores data in JSON-like documents (flexible schema).
        . Part of AWS’s NoSQL database family (like DynamoDB, Neptune, ElastiCache).

    2. Why Use It?
        . MongoDB workloads can migrate with minimal code changes.
        . Fully managed → AWS handles patching, scaling, backups, HA.
        . Useful when apps need flexible schemas, unlike relational DBs.

    3. Core Features
        . Scalable → up to 64TB storage, auto-growing.
        . High availability → 3 replicas across 3 AZs.
        . Read replicas → up to 15 for read scaling.
        . Backup & Restore → Continuous backup to S3 + PITR (point-in-time recovery).
        . Monitoring → CloudWatch metrics, Performance Insights.

    4. Security
        . Runs inside VPC for network isolation.
        . Encryption at rest (KMS) + in transit (TLS).
        . IAM integration for access management.
        . Fine-grained database user authentication/authorization.

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
            . Instance hours (similar to RDS pricing tiers).
            . Storage (per GB-month).
            . I/O requests.
            . Backup storage.
        . No license cost (unlike MongoDB Enterprise).

    6. Industry Standards
        . Use DocumentDB when:
            . You need MongoDB-compatible workloads with AWS-managed infra.
            . Schema flexibility is required (storing varied JSON docs).
            . Deploy Multi-AZ for production.
            . Use read replicas for scaling queries.
            . Store snapshots/backups in S3 for DR.
            . Encrypt with KMS for compliance.
            . Monitor with CloudWatch alarms (CPU, connections, IOPS).

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . Content Management Systems → flexible content models.
        . Catalogs/E-commerce → products with varying attributes.
        . IoT apps → device data stored as JSON docs.
        . Mobile/Web Apps → session storage, profiles, settings.
        . Analytics → ingest JSON event logs, analyze later.

    8. Summary
        . Amazon DocumentDB = MongoDB-compatible, fully managed document DB.
            . Great for JSON/document-heavy workloads.
            . Scales automatically, high availability built-in.
            . Industry best practices = multi-AZ, replicas, encryption, CloudWatch monitoring.

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

    1. What is RDS?
        . A fully managed relational database service.
        . Supports multiple database engines:
            . MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server.
        . AWS handles patching, backups, scaling, replication, monitoring.

    2. Features
        . Multi-AZ deployment → high availability & failover.
        . Read replicas → scale reads.
        . Automated backups & snapshots.
        . Encryption → KMS at rest, TLS in transit.
        . Monitoring → CloudWatch + Enhanced Monitoring.

    3. Best For
        . Traditional apps needing standard relational databases.
        . Enterprises migrating Oracle/SQL Server workloads.
        . Web apps (MySQL/Postgres), ERP, CRM.



Amazon Aurora
    1. What is Aurora?
        . A cloud-native relational database engine, part of RDS family.
        . Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, but 5x faster than MySQL / 3x faster than PostgreSQL.
        . Built by AWS for performance + scalability.

    2. Features
        . Distributed storage → data replicated across 6 copies in 3 AZs.
        . Aurora Replicas → up to 15 low-latency replicas.
        . Global Database → multi-region replication with <1s lag.
        . Serverless option → Aurora Serverless v2 auto-scales capacity.
        . Fault-tolerant & self-healing storage.
        . Backtrack → rewind DB to a point in time without restoring snapshot.

    3. Best For
        . Cloud-native apps needing high performance & scalability.
        . SaaS apps, e-commerce, gaming, financial apps.
        . When RDS MySQL/Postgres performance isn’t enough.


RDS vs Aurora – Key Differences

    | Feature         | Amazon RDS                                     | Amazon Aurora                                    |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Engines**     | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server | MySQL & PostgreSQL compatible only               |
    | **Performance** | Standard (depends on engine)                   | 3–5x faster (cloud-optimized)                    |
    | **Replication** | Up to 5 read replicas                          | Up to 15 Aurora replicas                         |
    | **Storage**     | EBS-backed, AZ-limited                         | Distributed, auto-healing, 6 copies across 3 AZs |
    | **Global**      | Cross-region read replicas (manual)            | Aurora Global DB (multi-region, <1s lag)         |
    | **Scalability** | Vertical + read replicas                       | Vertical + more replicas + serverless            |
    | **Backups**     | Automated snapshots                            | Continuous backup + Backtrack                    |
    | **Cost**        | Lower (good for legacy/standard DBs)           | Higher, but better performance/scale             |


Industry Standards
    . Use RDS for:
        . Legacy apps (Oracle, SQL Server).
        . Simple workloads (small web apps, ERP).
        . When full DB engine support is needed.
    . Use Aurora for:
        . Cloud-native, high-performance apps.
        . SaaS, e-commerce, gaming, analytics.
        . Global apps requiring multi-region HA.
        . Autoscaling workloads (Aurora Serverless).

Typical Corporate Use Cases
    . RDS Oracle/SQL Server → ERP, HRMS, finance systems.
    . RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL → Web apps, CMS.
    . Aurora MySQL/Postgres → E-commerce, gaming, real-time apps with heavy reads/writes.
    . Aurora Global DB → Banking/FinTech apps requiring multi-region DR.

Summary
    . Amazon RDS = Managed relational DBs (traditional engines).
    . Amazon Aurora = AWS’s cloud-optimized MySQL/Postgres with high performance, HA, and global scalability.
    . Industry best practice → Start with RDS, move to Aurora when you need scalability + performance.

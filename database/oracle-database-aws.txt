Oracle Database on AWS – Key Pointers

1. What Options Do You Have?

    . Amazon RDS for Oracle (Managed)
        . Fully managed by AWS (patching, backups, HA).
        . Supports Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition.
        . Multi-AZ deployments for HA.
        . Automated backups, monitoring, scaling.
        . Licensing:
            . License Included (AWS provides Standard Edition license).
            . Bring Your Own License (BYOL) (you use your existing Oracle licenses).

    . Oracle Database on EC2 (Self-Managed)
        . You install Oracle DB on an EC2 instance.
        . Full control over database configuration, tuning, licensing.
        . Best when you need custom Oracle features not supported in RDS.
        . Higher operational overhead (patching, HA, backups = your responsibility).

    . VMware Cloud on AWS + Oracle
        . Run Oracle inside VMware Cloud on AWS.
        . Often used in hybrid cloud migrations.

2. Key Features of RDS for Oracle
    . Multi-AZ failover → automatic HA.
    . Read Replicas → scale read workloads.
    . Automatic backups + PITR (Point-in-time recovery).
    . Monitoring → CloudWatch + Enhanced Monitoring.
    . Encryption → KMS at rest, TLS in transit.
    . Integration with AWS services (S3, CloudTrail, IAM).

3. Why Enterprises Use Oracle on AWS
    . Many legacy apps (ERP, CRM, HRMS, finance) are built on Oracle.
    . AWS allows them to lift-and-shift without rewriting the app.
    . RDS reduces operational overhead, EC2 gives full control.


4. Security
    . VPC isolation.
    . KMS encryption.
    . IAM integration for managing DB credentials (via Secrets Manager).
    . CloudTrail auditing for compliance (HIPAA, PCI DSS, FedRAMP).


5. Cost Model
    . RDS for Oracle → Pay per instance-hour + storage + I/O + backups.
       . License Included = higher hourly cost, no separate Oracle license needed.
       . BYOL = lower AWS cost, but you must manage Oracle licenses.
    . EC2 Oracle → Pay for EC2 + EBS + Oracle license separately.

6. Industry Standards
    . Use RDS for Oracle when:
        . You want managed Oracle DB (patching, backups handled by AWS).
        . You don’t need every Oracle Enterprise feature.
    . Use EC2 with Oracle when:
        . You need fine-grained control (custom tuning, RAC, Data Guard, GoldenGate).
        . You have complex Oracle workloads not supported by RDS.
    . Best Practices:
        . Run Multi-AZ for HA.
        . Encrypt with KMS.
        . Use IAM + Secrets Manager for credential rotation.
        . Automate DR with cross-region replication or GoldenGate.

7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
    . Banking/Finance → Core banking apps still Oracle-heavy.
    . ERP (SAP, PeopleSoft, Oracle E-Business Suite) → requires Oracle backend.
    . Healthcare → patient systems, compliance-critical workloads.
    . Government → Oracle-based legacy apps modernized on AWS.

8. Summary
    . RDS for Oracle → best for most managed use cases (Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition with some features).
    . Oracle on EC2 → best for custom/advanced workloads (RAC, Data Guard, full Enterprise features).
    . Industry best practice → use RDS unless you specifically need full Oracle customization, then go with EC2.

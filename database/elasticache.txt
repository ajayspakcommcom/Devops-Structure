Amazon ElastiCache – Key Pointers

    1. What is ElastiCache?
        . A fully managed in-memory data store and caching service.
        . Supports two popular engines:
            . Redis (more advanced: pub/sub, streams, persistence).
            . Memcached (simple, fast, distributed cache).
        . Used to speed up apps by reducing database load and latency.

    2. Why Use It?
        . Microsecond latency for reads/writes.
        . Reduce load on RDS/Aurora/DynamoDB.
        . Improve scalability of apps with high request volumes.
        . Built-in replication, failover, backups (Redis).

    3. Deployment Options
        . Cluster mode disabled (single shard + replicas) → simpler, single write node.
        . Cluster mode enabled (sharding) → horizontal scaling across multiple shards, each with replicas.

    4. Features
        . Automatic failover (Redis Multi-AZ).
        . Persistence (Redis snapshot backups, AOF).
        . Security: VPC isolation, encryption (in-transit + at rest), IAM auth.
        . Scalability: Up to millions of ops/sec.
        . Monitoring: CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, eviction count).

    5. Cost Model
        . Pay for:
            . Node type (vCPU, memory).
            . Cluster size (shards, replicas).
            . Data transfer.
        . No extra cost for ElastiCache itself — just infra.
        . Reserved nodes → 30–50% cheaper for 1–3 year terms.

    6. Industry Standards
    ✅  . Use Redis for:
            . Caching (web sessions, DB query results).
            . Real-time analytics (leaderboards, counters).
            . Pub/Sub messaging.
            . Queues and streams.
        . Use Memcached for:
            . Simple key-value caching (stateless apps).
            . Horizontal scale-out with many nodes.
        . Best practices:
            . Deploy Multi-AZ with auto-failover for prod.
            . Enable encryption + AUTH.
            . Monitor evictions + CPU/memory usage.
            . Use Cluster Mode (Redis) for >100GB datasets.

    7. Typical Corporate Use Cases
        . E-commerce → Cache product catalog, session data.
        . Gaming → Real-time leaderboards, matchmaking.
        . Social media → Feed caching, pub/sub notifications.
        . Finance → Low-latency transaction/session caching.
        . IoT → Real-time stream processing.

    8. Summary
        Amazon ElastiCache = managed Redis/Memcached for caching & real-time data.
            . Redis = rich features (replication, persistence, pub/sub).
            . Memcached = simple, high-throughput cache.
            . Industry best practices = Redis Multi-AZ, encryption, monitoring, reserved nodes for cost optimization.
